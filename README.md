## About the project

### Description 
Hi! This is my work for the Semester Project 1 course in the Front-end Development studies at [Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/). The assignment was to create an interactive website for a science museum called the Community Science Museum. 
The goal of the project is to put into practice the skills learned over the first semester of studies.

#### Brief
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

#### Website: [Community Science Museum ](https://sciencemuseumsp1.netlify.app/)

## Built with
The website is built using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.
